        <p>By default, **drop-in.css** uses several shades of gray for background and font colors, and two highly-contrasting red shades for inactive and active links. This color scheme was chosen for maximum contrast and readability, but it may be a bit bold for some projects. If you want to use a different set of colors, change out the colors assigned in this section, following the comments for each color declaration.</p>
        <p>The section of **drop-in.css** that styles the app's header will give you a logo in the form of the app's name in the site's display font, in very large type, at the left edge of the header section. The nav element will display as a horizontal series of links, separated by vertical bars, at the right edge of the header.</p>
