#### Drop-In CSS Stylesheets for Web App MVPs

This repo will be the home for further development of the drop-in.css stylesheet that instantly styles web apps in development. The previous incarnation of this repo, which was aimed specifically at Ruby/Sinatra and Ruby/Rails apps, can still be found at my [CSS for Sinatra](https://github.com/webdevjeffus/css-for-sinatra). I made the decision to shift development to this repo in order to make the Drop-In stylesheet concept framework-agnostic, while preserving the original repo.
